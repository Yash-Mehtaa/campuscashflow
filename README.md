# 💸 CampusCashflow — Student Budget & “Can I Buy It?” App

> Moving to a new country is exciting, but as an international student in the U.S. I quickly learned that managing money each month was harder than I imagined. Tuition bills, rent, groceries, weekend plans, everything came at once, and knowing how much I could safely spend was a constant guessing game. Talking with friends showed me I wasn’t alone: most students were juggling spreadsheets, bank apps, and mental math just to figure out their balance.  
>
> That inspired me to build **CampusCashflow**, a clear and lightweight desktop app that turns messy finances into one live number — how much you actually have left this month. I started with a simple student budget tool and, step by step, kept refining the design and interface until it became something anyone can use. Today it is just as helpful for working adults as it is for students, making personal finance approachable for anyone who wants clarity and confidence with their money.
